# Dotfiles
> My precious Dotfiles. I'm evolving this continuously as I learn more about Vim, Tmux and Fish. You'll maybe see some bad practices, don't judge bro!

- [Neovim](#neovim)
- [Tmux](#tmux)


## NeoVim

I organized and split Plugins & Settings in `/modules`.
The `init.vim` file just loads all configuration modules.
The numbers are there for load hierarchy.

## Tmux

You may noticed the weird `.mj` in `/tmux`. I symlinked basic conf files to have everything in one folder.
